  # 1: Adjustments made by Johanna in consequence of the ARIADNE model intercomparison in 2026:
  #    Introducing an annual mileage reduction due to the covid pandemic for EUR countries to match rising vehicle stock reported by EU pocketbook data even with demand dip.
  #    source that documents annual mileage dip due to covid-pandemic: Odyssee-Mure "after a sharp decrease in 2020 in most countries (-13% at EU level)"
  #    For now we do not assume a mileage recovery in the years after 2020 (as reported by Odyssee-Mure), because we do no cover the energy service demand
  #    dynamics yet sufficiently (increases again after 2022).
  #    To get closer to the reported vehicle stock increase (EU pocket book data) we keep the annual mileage reduction

  # 2: Assume missing data
  # a) Some modes and technologies are missing an annual mileage
  # TRACCS sets annual mileage for not available technologies in certain countries
  # (e.g. NG or BEVs in early years) to zero.
  # This is not helpful for us. We therefore assign a "hypothetical" annual mileage that
  # can be used for fleet calculation once the technologies get into the mix in later years

  # not planned for non-motorized cycling)
