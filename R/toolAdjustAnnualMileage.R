#2: Assume missing data
#a) Some modes and technologies are missing an annual mileage
  # TRACCS sets annual mileage for not available technologies in certain countries
  # (e.g. NG or BEVs in early years) to zero.
  # This is not helpful for us. We therefore assign a "hypothetical" annual mileage that
  # can be used for fleet calculation once the technologies get into the mix in later years
  dt[value == 0, value := NA]
  # Non-motorized modes do not get an annual mileage (no fleet tracking possible for walking/
  # not planned for non-motorized cycling)
  completeData <- completeData[!univocalName %in% c("Cycle", "Walk")]
  dt <- merge.data.table(completeData, dt, all = TRUE)
  # For some regions an annual mileage is provided for certain vehicle types, but no demand.
  # These values need to be deleted
  dt <- dt[!is.na(check)]
  # update variable and unit for introduced NAs
  dt[, unit := "vehkm/veh/yr"][, variable := "Annual mileage"][, check := NULL]
  # Average first within regions over technologies -> e.g. BEV gets the same value as other technologies
  dt[, value := ifelse(is.na(value), mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), value), by = c("region", "period", "univocalName")]
  # If there are still NAs, average over regions -> e.g. ICE in FRA gets the same value as ICE in DEU
  dt[, value := ifelse(is.na(value), mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), value), by = c("period", "univocalName", "technology")]


#b) Annual Mileage for Trucks is missing completely - insert assumptions made by Alois in 2022 (probably from ARIADNE)
  annualMileageTrucks <- fread(
    text = "univocalName, annualMileage
              Truck (0-3_5t), 21500
              Truck (7_5t), 34500

              Truck (26t), 74000
              Truck (40t), 136500")
  dt <- merge.data.table(dt, annualMileageTrucks, by = "univocalName", all.x = TRUE, allow.cartesian = TRUE)
  dt[, value := ifelse(!is.na(annualMileage), annualMileage, value)][, annualMileage := NULL]

#c) We do not have vintage tracking for the rest of the modes -> insert zeros
   #Later on it would be great to top up this data
